# River Capture Identification Protocol in the Paraná Basin - Ourinhos Region

## Overview

This project focuses on the study of river capture phenomena within the Paraná Sedimentary Basin, with a specific emphasis on the Ourinhos area. The Paraná Basin, spanning across several South American countries, is known for its rich geological features and complex drainage systems. The Ourinhos area, in particular, presents an exceptional opportunity to explore the process of river capture or stream piracy, where rivers or streams are diverted from their original courses due to natural processes such as erosion, tectonic movements, or sediment deposition.

## Objectives

- To outline a comprehensive methodology for the identification and analysis of drainage capture within the Paraná Basin, emphasizing the Ourinhos region.
- To examine topographical, geological, and hydrological data to understand the factors contributing to river capture events.
- To enhance our knowledge of the fluvial dynamics and landscape evolution in the Paraná Sedimentary Basin, contributing to broader geomorphological studies.

## Scope

The protocol will cover:
- Detailed guidelines for collecting and analyzing data related to river capture.
- Case studies highlighting specific instances of river capture within the Ourinhos area.
- Techniques for utilizing satellite imagery, GIS data, and field observations to identify and confirm river capture events.

## Importance

Studying river capture in the Ourinhos area offers invaluable insights into the evolution history of the Paraná Basin's fluvial systems. This research not only contributes to our understanding of geomorphological processes but also aids in the prediction and management of water resources in the region. By documenting and analyzing these natural phenomena, we can better understand the dynamic landscape of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin.

## Contribution Guidelines

Researchers and students interested in contributing to this project are encouraged to adhere to the following guidelines:
- Ensure all data and analyses are rigorously documented and sourced.
- Collaborate closely with team members to share findings and insights.
- Follow ethical standards for environmental research, respecting the natural habitats and communities involved in the study.
